# Graded Project - Mahanoro Station

![Design preview for the Mahanoro station coding challenge](./design/1.png)

## The challenge

The challenge was to build out this app and get it working with **redux**, **compound components** and **styled components** and making it look as close to the design as possible, but there are only few thing that I have done with it.
This is a website that will allow us to reserve some seats in _"Taxi brousses"_ departing from Mahanoro station.

For now: 
    User can :
        - Pick a city from the city list
        - see a page where they can pick available seats. This was not finished as I was stuck with some problems.

## Improvement:
  I still have a lot to go with this project such as:
        - Selecting one or more seats in the car, and see how much it's going to cost
        - Confirming the booking
        - Seeing user's confirmed bookings on the 'My account'page
        - Modifying the user's information, like name or phone number, on that same page.
